DupsWorks
=========

Scripts which build an OpsWorks Stack with HA-NAT Layer


Summary
--------

### Application environments need High-Availability

Amazon VPC and OpsWorks are amazing solution for publish applications.  
Suppose we are constructing such a structure:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img width="360px" style="max-width:100%;" alt="03_heartbeat.png" src="/docs/images/02_working_correctly.png" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

that has **4 subnets**

* public subnet 1
* private subnet 1 (connectable to the Internet due to nat1)
* public subnet 2
* private subnet 2 (connectable to the Internet due to nat2)


To avoid to enclose Single Point Of Failure, it is preffered to have such a mechanism.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img width="360px" style="max-width:100%;" alt="03_heartbeat.png" src="/docs/images/03_heartbeat.png" />
    </td>
    <td>
      <img width="360px" style="max-width:100%;" alt="04_nat1_failure.png" src="/docs/images/05_nat2_failure.png" />
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>checking heartbeat each other</th>
    <th>automatic failovering and recovering</th>
  </tr>
</table>

But constructing as above is hard a little bit.


### What does DupsWorks do?

DupsWorks makes it easy to build a VPC sutructure as above, OpsWorks Stack, NAT Layer and instances, and install some scripts to NAT instances that provides High-Availability.

All processes are below:

1. create VPC
1. create 4 subnets
1. create an OpsWorks stack
1. create OpsWorks layers
  1. admin layer (for gateway instances)
  1. nat layer
1. set permissions (optional)
2. create OpsWorks instances
  1. 1 admin instance
  1. 2 NAT instances
1. start NAT instances
1. configure route
  1. public subnets -> internet gateway
  1. private subnets -> nat instances
  1. checking heartbeat route
1. configure NAT instances
  1. disable Source/dest. check.
  1. set '1' to net.ipv4.ip_forward using sysctl
  1. configure iptables and enable IP Masquerading
1. install scripts(check heartbeat and failover) to NAT instances.


Requirements
-------------

Dupsworks depends on Python 2.7 and some packages. You can install them using pip:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage
-----

### Script Settings

1. Copy ``settings.cfg.example`` to ``settings.cfg``.
1. Edit params in ``[PersonalSettings]`` section.

#### Example:

```ini:settings.cfg
[PersonalSettings]
vpc_name = MyVPC
vpc_cidr                    = 10.0.0.0/16
vpc_subnet_az1_public_cidr  = 10.0.0.0/24
vpc_subnet_az1_private_cidr = 10.0.128.0/24
vpc_subnet_az2_public_cidr  = 10.0.1.0/24
vpc_subnet_az2_private_cidr = 10.0.129.0/24
region                      = us-east-1
vpc_subnet_az1              = us-east-1a
vpc_subnet_az2              = us-east-1b
stack_name = MyStack
stack_service_role_arn = arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/aws-opsworks-service-role
stack_default_instance_profile_arn = arn:aws:iam::111111111111:instance-profile/aws-opsworks-ec2-role

    [[stack_permissions]]
        [[[hoge]]]
            iam_user_arn = arn:aws:iam::111111111111:user/hoge
            allow_ssh = True
            allow_sudo = True

```

### Security Credentials

Dupsworks use [boto](http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforpython/) and [awscli](http://aws.amazon.com/jp/cli/).

You need to set your AWS security credentials before the script is able to
connect to AWS. The SDK will automatically pick up credentials in environment
variables:

    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="Your AWS Access Key ID"
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="Your AWS Secret Access Key"

See the [Security Credentials](http://aws.amazon.com/security-credentials) page
for more information on getting your keys.

### Execute

    python build_stack.py
